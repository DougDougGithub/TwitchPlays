# TwitchPlays
This code is originally based off Wituz's Twitch Plays template, then expanded by DougDoug and DDarknut with help from Ottomated for the Youtube side. For now I am not reviewing any pull requests or code changes, this code is meant to be a simple prototype that is uploaded for educational purposes. But feel free to fork the project and create your own version!

As is tradition with Python projects, use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required packages.

A template example is shown in the games folder, where more games will be loaded over time, where I will be playing with chat and adding the code for the games there for fast loading/reference in the future.
